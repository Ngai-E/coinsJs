# Coin Universe Frontend applicaton

This Project was built to display reatime price changes in the crytocurrency world. It implements the following:
1. displays top 100 cryptocurrencies in a responsive grid showing the name, symbol, logo, price, chart variation etc.
2. displays top 5 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization in a pie chart.
3. shows visual indication for real time price changes.

In this folder, start up a simple HTTP server to serve up the site files on your local computer. 
Python has some simple tools to do this, and you don't even need to know Python. 
For most people, it's already installed on your computer.
In a terminal, check the version of Python you have: python -V. If you have Python 2.x, spin up the server with python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000 (or some other port, if port 8000 is already in use.) For Python 3.x, you can use python3 -m http.server 8000. If you don't have Python installed, navigate to Python's website to download and install the software.

With your server running, visit the site: http://localhost:8000, and look around for a bit to see what the current experience looks like.

When the server is up and running simply enter the url http://localhost:8000 in the browser to access the application.
